Activity 5: Feedback on Education Pathways application
<br/>
A functional requirement that can be added to the system is the inclusion of the previous year's syllabus for each course. This will help a student judge the learning outcomes and difficulty of a course.
<br/>
A non-function requirement that can be improved is legibility. Currently, the introduction text spans the entire screen, which makes it hard to read because there is too much eye movement needed. The text should be restricted to a small column (e.g. 800 pixels wide) at the center of the page.
